  questTitle: Battle of Bibracte
  questDescription: 'As dawn broke over the dense woods of Bibracte, I could feel
    the tension in the air, thick as the mist clinging to the ground. Today, I would
    fight alongside my brothers in Legion XIII Gemina against the united Gallic tribes,
    led by Vercingetorix himself. My heart raced, not just with fear but with anticipation.
    This was my chance to prove myself. '
