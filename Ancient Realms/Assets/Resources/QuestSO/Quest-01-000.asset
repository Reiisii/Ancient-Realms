  questTitle: The Gallic Wars
  questDescription: "You stand, freshly trained and battle-ready, as Gaul holds its
    breath. Rome\u2019s legions march ever closer, their armor gleaming like a threat
    against the horizon. The villages are tense; even the elders fall silent as whispers
    of invasion grow louder each day. Farmers grasp their tools as if they were weapons;
    warriors ready themselves, eyes set like flint."
