  description: Marcus Antonius, known in English as Mark Antony, was a Roman politician
    and general. A loyal supporter of Julius Caesar, he played a critical role in
    the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. His love affair
    with Cleopatra and subsequent defeat by Octavian (later Augustus) marked the
    end of his political career.
