  eventTitle: 54 BC | Death of Julia, Caesar's Daughter
  eventDescription: Julia, the daughter of Julius Caesar and the wife of Pompey,
    died in childbirth in 54 BC. Her death weakened the personal and political alliance
    between Caesar and Pompey. This loss contributed to the growing estrangement
    and eventual conflict between the two powerful leaders.
