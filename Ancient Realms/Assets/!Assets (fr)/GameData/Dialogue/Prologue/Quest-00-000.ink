Welcome, Tiro (Trainee). You stand now among the legions of Rome, the mightiest force ever assembled. But strength alone does not make a soldier.
Before you can wield a gladius or raise a shield, you must first master the basics. Today, we begin with movement. For in battle, your ability to move swiftly and with purpose can mean the difference between victory and defeat.
Let's start with the basics.
