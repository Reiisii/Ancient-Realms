Tiro! I see you've completed your Movement Training. Excellent work! #speaker:npc
Now, it's time to move on to the next stage—combat training. Every legionnaire must be skilled in the art of warfare, so are you prepared for the challenge ahead? #speaker:npc
Yes, ready for whatever's next! #speaker:player
That's the spirit! With soldiers like you, our enemies don't stand a chance. We're about to begin your combat training, and I'll be teaching you how to wield the gladius, defend with your scutum, and throw the pilum with precision. #speaker:npc
I'm ready to learn, Sir! #speaker:player
Let's start with the gladius, the sword that defines a Roman soldier. This weapon is more than just a tool—it's your companion in battle. You must protect it as you would your own life. Lose it, and you risk everything. #speaker:npc
Understood. I’ll take care of it. #speaker:player
The gladius is most effective when used to stab, not slash. A precise thrust can end a fight swiftly. Now, show me what you've learned—stab those training dummies 5 times. Remember, accuracy and speed are key! #speaker:npc
Got it. I’ll give it my best shot! #speaker:player

Tiro, you've done well with the gladius. But a Roman soldier must master more than just the sword. #speaker:npc
Now you will learn the art of the pilum, the javelin that can break through both shield and armor. The pilum is not just a throwing weapon but a tool of precision. #speaker:npc
Throwing with precision... Alright, let's try it! #speaker:player
Hold the pilum firmly, aim with your body, and release with strength and purpose. #speaker:npc
I’ll focus on my stance and aim. #speaker:player
To throw your pilum, hold the W key for a second, and when your target is in sight, release the key to throw the pilum. #speaker:npc
Holding, aiming... ready to throw! #speaker:player
-> DONE

Well done, Tiro! You've shown skill and determination in your training today. Each thrust of your gladius brings you closer to becoming a true legionnaire. #speaker:npc
Thank you, Sir! I’m honored to train with the legion. #speaker:player
Remember, the lessons learned here on the training grounds will save your life on the battlefield. Your gladius and pilum are not just weapons—they are extensions of your will, your discipline, and your duty to Rome. #speaker:npc
I'll remember that. They’re more than just weapons. #speaker:player
Dismissed, Tiro. Go to the Aquilifer for Equipment Training and Journal Training. #speaker:npc
Understood. Heading there now. #speaker:player
-> DONE

What is it, Tiro? Do the task I gave you—I don't have all day! #speaker:npc
On it, Sir! Just wanted to check in. #speaker:player
-> DONE

Pft—You better be ready next time! #speaker:npc
I will be, Sir. Won’t disappoint you! #speaker:player
-> DONE
