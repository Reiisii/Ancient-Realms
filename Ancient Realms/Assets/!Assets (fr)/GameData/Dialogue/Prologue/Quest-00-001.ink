Tiro! I see you've completed your Movement Training. Excellent work!
Now, it's time to move on to the next stage—combat training. Every legionnaire must be skilled in the art of warfare, so are you prepared for the challenge ahead?"
That's the spirit! With soldiers like you, our enemies don't stand a chance. We're about to begin your combat training, and I'll be teaching you how to wield the gladius, defend with your scutum, and throw the pilum with precision.
Let's start with the gladius, the sword that defines a Roman soldier. This weapon is more than just a tool—it's your companion in battle. You must protect it as you would your own life. Lose it, and you risk everything.
The gladius is most effective when used to stab, not slash. A precise thrust can end a fight swiftly. Now, show me what you've learned—stab those training dummies 10 times. Remember, accuracy and speed are key!

Well done, Tiro! You've shown skill and determination in your training today. Each thrust of your gladius brings you closer to becoming a true legionnaire.
Remember, the lessons learned here on the training grounds will save your life on the battlefield. Your gladius, scutum, and pilum are not just weapons—they are extensions of your will, your discipline, and your duty to Rome.
Dismissed, Tiro. Prepare yourself for what's next. This is just the beginning of your journey.
