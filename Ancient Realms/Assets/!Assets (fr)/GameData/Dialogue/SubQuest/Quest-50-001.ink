Hey! I need help with something! Can you help me? #speaker:npc
Sure, what do you need? #speaker:player
Good, good! Could you go talk to that guy over there and fetch something for me? It’s important! And, uh... try not to mention my name. He might be a little suspicious. #speaker:npc
Alright, I’ll see what he has to say. #speaker:player
-> DONE

== goal_0 ==
Ah yes, I’m that guy. What do you want? #speaker:npc
Jan Janius asked me to speak to you. He said you had some items? #speaker:player
Oh, Jan Janius, is it? Figures he wouldn’t come himself... Here, take these supplies to him, and tell him not to misplace them this time! #speaker:npc
Understood. I’ll make sure he gets them safely. #speaker:player
-> DONE

Ah, you’re back! And with the goods! Thank you, Legionnaire, you’re a lifesaver. Here, take this as a reward. It’s some of my finest work, and I rarely part with such treasures! Well... unless there’s food involved. #speaker:npc
Thanks, Jan Janius. I’ll put it to good use. #speaker:player
Now, if you’ll excuse me... all this talking has worked up an appetite. I must feast! #speaker:npc
Of course—enjoy! #speaker:player
