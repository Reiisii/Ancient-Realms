Ah, you’re here just in time! I’m nearly out of quality iron, and my work depends on it. 
Could you fetch a shipment of iron ore from Tiberius the Miner?
He’s expecting someone from me.

Jan Janius sent you, did he? 
Good! I have the iron ore ready, but these crates are heavy. You’ll need to carry them carefully don’t go dropping them now!

== goal_1 ==
You’ve brought the iron!
Just what I needed.
With this, I can keep the forge blazing.
Thank you, Tiro.
-> DONE
