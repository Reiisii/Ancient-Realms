Ah, there you are! A fresh recruit for the illustrious Legion XIII Gemina! Congratulations, [player]! 
You've joined one of the finest legions in all of Rome. I can already see the fire in your eyes—just what we need out there.
Since you are here I'm gonna tell you something...
But listen closely, the situation beyond our borders grows dire. Caesar is rounding up every available soldier, preparing us for a campaign that will test our mettle like never before. 
Word from scouts tells of unrest among the Gauls, especially near Bibracte. They sense our approach and are rallying their tribes, uniting under a single banner to stand against us.
With that being said, do me a favour will ya?
Speak to the others—there's wisdom to be gained from the veterans who have seen countless battles. They can teach you more than any training manual. 
Perhaps start with Maximus, the experienced swordsman by the armory, or Lucius, our strategist over by the maps. They’ll have valuable insight for you.
Once you are done come back to me.

Ah, a new recruit! Don’t let the weight of your armor drag you down. The key to a good fight is balance and focus.
In battle, it's not just about strength; it's about speed and precision. A swift blade can end a fight before it begins.
Also just a piece of advice never underestimate the gauls!
I've faced the Gauls before. They’re fierce and unpredictable. Respect them, or you’ll find yourself overwhelmed.
Remember always follow your comrades to battle, and move as a group never fight alone.
-> DONE

== goal_1 ==
The march to Bibracte will be treacherous. We need to stick together and remain vigilant at all times.
The Gauls will use every tactic in their book to throw us off balance. Expect ambushes and guerrilla warfare. Knowledge is our greatest weapon.
Stay informed about troop movements and anything unusual. Every bit of information can save lives.
We may be outnumbered, but we have training and discipline on our side. Stick to the plan, and we’ll show them the might of Rome.
-> DONE

== goal_2 ==
Ah, there you are! I trust you’ve gathered some useful insights from our veterans? They’ve seen battles that would turn a lesser man’s stomach.
As we prepare to march, I need every soldier ready. We’ll strike hard and fast at Bibracte. Keep your eyes open, and don’t hesitate to report anything unusual.
This is a critical moment for us. We’re not just fighting for territory; we’re fighting to show Rome's strength. You’ll have a chance to prove yourself out there. I expect you to rise to the occasion!
Now, go prepare yourself. Check your gear, sharpen your blade, and be ready for the command to march. Together, we will demonstrate what Legion XIII Gemina is capable of!
-> DONE

== goal_3 ==
Soldiers, gather round! I have urgent news from our scouts. They've spotted a group of approximately twenty Gallic soldiers camping in the woods nearby. Their presence poses a risk to our plans.
Legate Anthony has ordered us to disperse these scouts before they can report our movements to their tribes. We cannot afford any delays.
[player]!!! this is your moment, recruit. Prove your worth to the Legion XIII Gemina. I want you to take the lead in this operation. You’ll have the opportunity to show your skills in the field and gain the respect of your fellow soldiers.
I'll lend you 10 of our good men in this operation I trust you to bring them all back alive for the upcoming battle here in Bibracte.
Remember, this is not just about strength. Use your wits, coordinate with your comrades, and strike quickly. We need to send a clear message to the Gauls that we will not be trifled with!
Prepare yourself and gather a small group to assist you. Move swiftly, and return victorious. The eyes of the Legion are upon you!
