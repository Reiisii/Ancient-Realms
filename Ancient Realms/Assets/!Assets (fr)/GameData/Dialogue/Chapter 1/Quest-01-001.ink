Ah, there you are! A fresh recruit for the illustrious Legion XIII Gemina! Congratulations, [player]! #speaker:npc
Thank you! I’m excited to be here! #speaker:player
You've joined one of the finest legions in all of Rome. I can already see the fire in your eyes—just what we need out there. #speaker:npc
I appreciate that. What’s the situation like? #speaker:player
Since you are here, I'm gonna tell you something... But listen closely, the situation beyond our borders grows dire. Caesar is rounding up every available soldier, preparing us for a campaign that will test our mettle like never before. #speaker:npc
What do you mean by “test our mettle”? #speaker:player
Word from scouts tells of unrest among the Gauls, especially near Bibracte. They sense our approach and are rallying their tribes, uniting under a single banner to stand against us. #speaker:npc
So it’s serious, then? #speaker:player
Aye, it is. With that being said, do me a favor, will ya? #speaker:npc
Of course! What do you need? #speaker:player
Speak to the others—there's wisdom to be gained from the veterans who have seen countless battles. They can teach you more than any training manual. #speaker:npc
Got it! Who should I talk to first? #speaker:player
Perhaps start with Gaius, the experienced swordsman by the armory. He’s been through more battles than I can count. Or you could seek out Lucius, our strategist over by the maps. They’ll have valuable insights for you. #speaker:npc
I’ll make sure to speak with them. Anything else I should know? #speaker:player
Just remember, young recruit: knowledge is just as important as skill in the field. Learn from the past, and it will guide you through the future. Once you are done, come back to me. #speaker:npc
Thank you for the advice. I’ll be back soon! #speaker:player
-> DONE


== goal_0 ==
Ah, a new recruit! Don’t let the weight of your armor drag you down. The key to a good fight is balance and focus. #speaker:npc
Thanks, Gaius! I’ll keep that in mind. #speaker:player
In battle, it's not just about strength; it's about speed and precision. A swift blade can end a fight before it begins. #speaker:npc
That makes sense. I’ve always believed a quick strike can make all the difference. #speaker:player
Also, just a piece of advice: never underestimate the Helvetii tribe! #speaker:npc
Why’s that? #speaker:player
I've faced the Germans before. They’re fierce and unpredictable. Respect them, or you’ll find yourself overwhelmed. #speaker:npc
I’ll remember that. I’ve heard stories about their tactics. #speaker:player
Good. Always follow your comrades into battle, and move as a group—never fight alone. You’ll be stronger together. #speaker:npc
I appreciate the advice, Gaius. I’ll be sure to stick with my squad. #speaker:player
Stay sharp, recruit. You’ve got the potential, but it’s up to you to hone it. Remember, a good soldier is always learning. #speaker:npc
Thanks for the encouragement! I’ll do my best. #speaker:player
-> DONE


== goal_1 ==
The march to Bibracte will be treacherous. We need to stick together and remain vigilant at all times. #speaker:npc
The Germans will use every tactic in their book to throw us off balance. Expect ambushes and guerrilla warfare. Knowledge is our greatest weapon. #speaker:npc
Stay informed about troop movements and anything unusual. Every bit of information can save lives. #speaker:npc
We may be outnumbered, but we have training and discipline on our side. Stick to the plan, and we’ll show them the might of Rome. #speaker:npc
Don’t let the numbers fool you. In battle, strategy wins over brute force. Always anticipate their next move. #speaker:npc
And remember, communicate with your fellow soldiers. A unified front is our best defense against the chaos of war. #speaker:npc
Be ready, recruit. We’ll face the Germans head-on, and I expect nothing less than your full commitment. #speaker:npc
-> DONE


== goal_2 ==
Ah, there you are! I trust you’ve gathered some useful insights from our veterans? They’ve seen battles that would turn a lesser man’s stomach. #speaker:npc
Yes, I learned a lot from both Gaius and Lucius. #speaker:player
As we prepare to march, I need every soldier ready. We’ll strike hard and fast at Bibracte. Keep your eyes open, and don’t hesitate to report anything unusual. #speaker:npc
I won’t let you down. #speaker:player
This is a critical moment for us. We’re not just fighting for territory; we’re fighting to show Rome's strength. You’ll have a chance to prove yourself out there. I expect you to rise to the occasion! #speaker:npc
I’ll do my best to live up to the Legion’s reputation. #speaker:player
Now, go prepare yourself. Check your gear, sharpen your blade, and be ready for the command to march. Together, we will demonstrate what Legion XIII Gemina is capable of! #speaker:npc
I’ll get right on it. We won’t disappoint you! #speaker:player
-> DONE

== goal_3 ==
Soldiers, gather round! I have urgent news from our scouts. They've spotted a group of approximately twenty Gallic soldiers camping in the woods nearby. Their presence poses a risk to our plans. #speaker:npc
Legate Anthony has ordered us to disperse these scouts before they can report our movements to their tribes. We cannot afford any delays. #speaker:npc
[player]!!! This is your moment, recruit. Prove your worth to the Legion XIII Gemina. I want you to take the lead in this operation. You’ll have the opportunity to show your skills in the field and gain the respect of your fellow soldiers. #speaker:npc
I'll lend you 15 of our good men for this operation. I trust you to bring them all back alive for the upcoming battle here in Bibracte. #speaker:npc
Remember, this is not just about strength. Use your wits, coordinate with your comrades, and strike quickly. We need to send a clear message to the Germans that we will not be trifled with! #speaker:npc
Prepare yourself and gather a small group to assist you. Move swiftly, and return victorious. The eyes of the Legion are upon you! #speaker:npc
I won't let you down! I'll make sure we complete the mission and come back safe. #speaker:player
-> DONE


== goal_4 ==
Well done, soldier! You've proven yourself out there, and your actions have not gone unnoticed. The strength and discipline you displayed are what make Rome mighty. Consider this a victory worthy of the Legion! #speaker:npc
I appreciate your praise, Centurion. It was a team effort. #speaker:player
Now, there’s no time to rest on our laurels. The Legate himself, Mark Antony, is expecting you. Head to him at once for a full mission update and to receive your next orders. #speaker:npc
Understood. I’ll make my way to him right away. #speaker:player
Remember, recruit, your journey has only just begun. Mark Antony will have great plans for you, and your continued success will strengthen our Legion. Stay sharp! #speaker:npc
I won't let you down, Centurion. I’ll report to Mark Antony immediately. #speaker:player
-> DONE


== goal_5 ==
Well done, soldier. You’ve served the Thirteenth with honor, and your deeds have not gone unnoticed. #speaker:npc
Thank you, Mark Antony. It means a lot coming from you. #speaker:player
But listen carefully—there’s news from the front. The Helvetii tribe have been spotted advancing on Bibracte. We cannot let them gain ground. #speaker:npc
I understand. We’ll be ready to face them. #speaker:player
We’ll be marching soon to meet them, and we’ll need every legionary ready and prepared. #speaker:npc
I’ll gather my comrades and ensure they’re ready. #speaker:player
Find your Centurion and deliver this message. Tell him we go to Bibracte, where Rome will once again make her mark. #speaker:npc
Understood. I won’t delay. #speaker:player
Go now, and be swift! The future of the Legion depends on our actions today. #speaker:npc
I won’t let you down, Mark Antony. I’ll deliver the message right away. #speaker:player
-> DONE

== goal_6 ==
So, the Germans march to Bibracte, do they? It seems they’ve forgotten the bite of Roman steel. #speaker:npc
No matter—we’ll be there to remind them. #speaker:npc
You’ve done well, soldier. Thanks to you, we’re one step closer to victory. #speaker:npc
Prepare yourself; the Thirteenth marches soon, and we’ll need every able man ready for what lies ahead. #speaker:npc
Dismissed. Ready yourself for battle—and know that Rome is watching. #speaker:npc
I won’t let you down, Centurion. We’ll make Rome proud! #speaker:player

Well done Legionnaire... The Battle of Bibracte will be spoken of for generations, and you have proven yourself as more than just another legionnaire. The blood, sweat, and resolve you showed today embody the spirit of Legion XIII Gemina. #speaker:npc
Thank you, Centurion. It was a fierce fight, but we held strong. #speaker:player
Indeed, we did. The Gauls fought with all the fury of their land, and yet we stood firm. Caesar himself has taken note of the valor displayed on this field. Let this victory serve as a reminder: no force will outmatch the discipline and strength of Rome. #speaker:npc
What happens now? #speaker:player
Looks like you proved yourself in this battle talk to Legate Anthony he wants to talk to you. I notified him about your performance today. #speaker:npc

Thank you, sir. It was an honor to fight for Rome. #speaker:player
More than an honor—you proved yourself a leader among men. Your courage, quick thinking, and unwavering resolve turned the tide when we needed it most. For this, Caesar and I have agreed: you are to be promoted. #speaker:npc
Promoted, sir? #speaker:player
Yes, [player]. From this day forth, you shall hold the title of Centurion of Legion XIII Gemina. Wear it with pride, and remember the weight it carries. Your responsibility now extends beyond yourself—you will lead, inspire, and guide your brothers in battle. #speaker:npc

Good. Gather your troops and prepare for what lies ahead. Glory waits for no one. Lead them well, and Rome will sing your name. but this campaign is far from over. #speaker:npc
